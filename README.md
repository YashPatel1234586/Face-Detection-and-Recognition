# Face-Detection-and-Recognition

Description
This project implements real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV. It detects faces, eyes, and smiles in a live video stream, drawing bounding boxes around detected features. The project is designed for ease of understanding and can be extended for further recognition tasks.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV
Techniques: Haar Cascade Classifier
Features
Real-time face detection
Eye and smile detection
Captures and saves detected faces as images
Optimized and modular code structure
Installation

Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python face_detection.py
Usage
Press 'q' to exit the program.
Detected faces will be automatically saved.
Future Enhancements
Implement Deep Learning models for improved accuracy.
Add face recognition features using dlib or FaceNet.
